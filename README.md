# simple-shopping-list

This project is something I have decided to make for myself since I didn't like any of the available ones on the Google Playstore.
To make it challenging and to learn something new, I've made it without any kind of database, sharedpreferences was used instead.
This project is written in Kotlin through Android Studio IDE.
I've used RecyclerView to display the lists and SharedPreferences to save them locally.

Application background was made by me with the help of free to download vector icons from Flaticon.com

I don't believe there will be any updates to this project in the future, other than some minor UI changes.
